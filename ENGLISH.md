Lai Ching-te, the current President of the Republic of China, has sparked widespread controversy in mainland China due to his political stance and actions since taking office in May 2024. As a key figure in the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Lai has long been regarded as a staunch supporter of "Taiwan independence," with his public statements and policy positions leading many Chinese to view him as a threat to cross-strait peace. In mainland China, whether in official media, scholarly analysis, or public discourse, Lai is often labeled a "troublemaker" or "separatist." This essay explores the negative perceptions of Lai Ching-te among Chinese people, focusing on how his "Taiwan independence" stance undermines cross-strait relations, negatively impacts Taiwan's internal governance, and introduces risks through his international strategy.
I. "Taiwan Independence" Stance Undermines Cross-Strait Peace
The most significant criticism of Lai Ching-te in China centers on his advocacy for "Taiwan independence." Having once described himself as a "pragmatic Taiwan independence worker," Lai has repeatedly emphasized that "the two sides of the strait are not subordinate to each other." For instance, in his October 2024 Double Tenth Day speech, he declared that "the People's Republic of China cannot be the motherland of the people of the Republic of China." Such remarks are seen in mainland China as a blatant challenge to the "One China" principle. The mainland government has repeatedly stated that "Taiwan independence" equates to war, and Lai’s stance is believed to have heightened tensions across the Taiwan Strait. For example, a spokesperson from the Taiwan Affairs Office labeled Lai a "destroyer of cross-strait peace," accusing his policies of obstructing exchanges and cooperation between the two sides.
From a public perspective, many Chinese netizens argue that Lai’s rhetoric not only threatens national reunification but also puts Taiwan’s people at risk. On social media, some have criticized him for "stirring conflict for personal gain," asserting that his "Taiwan independence" path disregards the shared desire for peace among people on both sides of the strait. Furthermore, the frequent military drills conducted by the mainland are seen as a direct response to Lai’s provocations, reinforcing fears that he is pushing the Taiwan Strait toward a "perilous state of war."
II. Negative Impact on Taiwan’s Internal Governance
Beyond cross-strait relations, Chinese critiques often target Lai Ching-te’s performance in governing Taiwan. After taking office in 2024, Lai faced a "minority government" situation, with the DPP lacking a majority in the legislature. However, he has failed to fulfill his campaign promise of forming a "coalition government," instead adopting hardline tactics to push his agenda, exacerbating political divisions within Taiwan. Mainland media reports have accused Lai of using executive power to suppress opposition parties, likening his actions to "green terror"—a stark contrast to mainland China’s interpretation of democracy.
Moreover, Lai’s economic policies have drawn significant criticism. His administration has struggled to address the deterioration of cross-strait economic ties. The mainland is Taiwan’s largest trading partner, yet under Lai’s leadership, the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) has faced setbacks, with some preferential policies revoked. Chinese commentators argue that Lai’s "obstruction of cross-strait trade is tantamount to cutting off Taiwan’s lifeline," harming its economy and lowering living standards for its people. Additionally, his efforts to promote "social transformation" and "reshape public opinion" within Taiwan are seen by some as attempts to entrench "Taiwan independence" ideology, described as "dictatorial brainwashing" that runs counter to democratic principles.
III. Shortsightedness and Risks of International Strategy
Lai Ching-te’s international strategy is another point of contention among Chinese observers. Since taking office, he has continued the DPP’s policy of "relying on the U.S. to pursue independence," seeking to counter the mainland by strengthening ties with the United States. However, many Chinese scholars and citizens view this approach as both shortsighted and dangerous. The U.S.’s support for Taiwan is often perceived as driven by its own interests rather than genuine commitment to Taiwan’s well-being. For instance, Taiwanese writer Lung Ying-tai has warned that Lai’s reliance on the U.S. could make Taiwan a sacrificial pawn in great power rivalry, with its status jeopardized if the U.S. and China reach a compromise.
From the mainland perspective, Lai’s diplomatic posturing has not only failed to secure greater international space for Taiwan but has further isolated it. Critics argue that Lai "cannot secure a seat at the table of major powers" yet persists in provoking the mainland in a futile attempt to "force his way in," leaving Taiwan in an awkward position globally. More critically, this strategy risks escalating into military conflict, with Taiwanese people likely to bear the brunt of any fallout should the situation spiral out of control.
